📱 Mobile App
React Native for Android & iOS
Expo for BLE & camera/mic access
Firebase: Auth, Realtime DB, Cloud Storage
WebRTC / Agora SDK: Real-time video/audio streaming
🌍 Maps & Routing
OpenStreetMap API
Crowd-sourced danger heatmaps
Geofencing with MapBox SDK / custom logic
🔗 IoT & BLE Integration
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) – for pairing wearables
MQTT Protocol – for wearable-to-app alerts
Raspberry Pi/Arduino Nano – optional prototyping
GATT Server – if smartwatch supports direct communication
🌐 Backend
Flask or Django – RESTful API server with AI integration
Node.js + WebSocket – optional for real-time streams
MongoDB/PostgreSQL – flexible data handling
SendGrid/Twilio – messaging and alerts
🔐 Security
AES-256 – Encryption for stored files
HTTPS & JWT – API communication
IPFS + Blockchain (Polygon/Ethereum) – For immutable evidence hashes
🧱 System Architecture (Simplified)

[Bluetooth Watch Button] --> BLE Signal --> [React Native App]
[Microphone Input] --> AssemblyAI --> CoreNLP --> LLaMA 2 (Threat Analysis)

IF Distress Detected:
 --> Trigger Alert
    --> Live Stream via WebRTC
    --> Location Sent via Firebase Dynamic Link
    --> Media Encrypted & Stored (Firebase / AWS S3)
    --> Alert Contacts via Twilio SMS / SendGrid Email

Geo Module: [OpenStreetMap] + [User Reports] + [Crime APIs] --> Route Suggestions & Safe Zones
📅 Development Roadmap

🔹 Phase 1: Core MVP
 React Native app with Firebase login
 Manual SOS + Shake Detection
 Trusted contacts + live location
 Basic BLE integration with smartwatch
🔹 Phase 2: AI & Streaming
 Integrate AssemblyAI + CoreNLP
 Local LLaMA 2 sentiment classifier (offline)
 Video/audio streaming to contacts
 Cloud storage of evidence
🔹 Phase 3: Smart Triggers & IoT
 BLE panic button fully functional
 Safe route + crime heatmap integration (OpenStreetMap)
 Crowdsourced map & group alerts
🔹 Phase 4: Stealth & Blockchain
 Disguised UI mode (calculator app)
 Blockchain evidence log via IPFS
 Fake call + helpline integration
 Final user testing and deployment
🧩 Optional Expansion Ideas

Integration with local law enforcement APIs for direct dispatch.
Support for elderly, disabled, or children with custom UI modes.
Voice biometrics for user authentication in stealth mode.
Integration with Apple/Google Health APIs for sensor-based triggers.
