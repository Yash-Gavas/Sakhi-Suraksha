12. Crowdsourced Danger Reports
Description: Users can tag unsafe locations.
Function:
Map overlays show user-generated danger zones.
AI scrapes Twitter & news APIs to update warnings.
13. Behavior-Based Trigger Prediction
Description: Learns user routine and predicts threat.
Function:
Anomalies like unusual time/place or stationary location for too long trigger checks or alerts.
